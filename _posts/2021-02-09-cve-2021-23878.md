Clear text storage of sensitive Information in memory vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) for Windows prior to 10.7.0 February 2021 Update allows a local user to view ENS settings and credentials via accessing process memory after the ENS administrator has performed specific actions.

To exploit this, the local user has to access the relevant memory location immediately after an ENS administrator has made a configuration change through the console on their machine.
