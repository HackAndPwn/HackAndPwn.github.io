In SmartBear Collaborator Server through 13.3.13302, use of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) API introduces a post-authentication Java deserialization vulnerability. The application's UpdateMemento class accepts a serialized Java object directly from the user without properly sanitizing it. A malicious object can be submitted to the server via an authenticated attacker to execute commands on the underlying system.
