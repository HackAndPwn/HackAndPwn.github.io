Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. Since part of Git for Windows' uninstaller is copied into the current user's temporary directory and run in that place, it is important to ensure that there are no malicious .dll file in that directory that might be loaded as part of loading the executable. However, the default system settings for TMP and TEMP are to point to C:\Windows\Temp, a folder that is world-writable (for historical reasons), and the SYSTEM user account inherits those settings. This means that any authenticated user can place malicious .dll files that are loaded when Git for Windows' uninstaller is run via the SYSTEM account. Fixes are available in Git for Windows v2.35.2 or newer. Users unable to upgrade may override SYSTEM's TMP environment variable to point to a directory exclusively under SYSTEM's control before running the uninstaller, clear C:\Windows\Temp of all .dll files before running the uninstaller, or run the uninstaller under an admin account rather than SYSTEM as a workaround.
