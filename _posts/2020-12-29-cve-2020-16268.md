The MSI installer in 1E Client 4.1.0.267 and 5.0.0.745 allows remote authenticated users and local users to gain elevated privileges via the repair option. This applies to installations that have a TRANSFORM (MST) with the option to disable the installation of the Nomad module. An attacker may craft a .reg file in a specific location that will be able to write to any registry key as an elevated user.
