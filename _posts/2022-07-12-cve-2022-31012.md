Git for Windows is a fork of Git that contains Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into C:\mingw64\bin\git.exe by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the C:\mingw64 folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in C:\.
