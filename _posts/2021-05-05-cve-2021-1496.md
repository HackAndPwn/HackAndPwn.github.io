A vulnerability in the install process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because the application loads an executable file from a user-writable directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a malicious executable file to a specific directory, which would be executed when the application is installed or upgraded. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
