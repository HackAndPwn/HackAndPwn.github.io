title: Windows 7 ESU Patching
original_date: 2020-05-23

---

With the May 2020 Windows 7 updates, I went on a mission to determine the minimum set of updates needed to enable all features within Windows 7, including optional hotfixes, and to have the most up-to-date installation possible.  After extensive testing, I concluded that 42 updates not offered through Windows Update would need to be installed to reach this objective.  The following sections describe the updates required and provide links to each.

> The base test image used for this research was 64-Bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1.  Microsoft Update was enabled, and all updates offered through Windows Update were installed prior to starting this investigation.

> I highly recommend both the [KUC Update Checker](http://windows-update-checker.com/) and [WSUS Offline Update](https://www.wsusoffline.net/) utilities.  I used both during this investigation in order to get to this minimum required set.  

### Enabling ESU Updates

This first section holds a single update required for ESU updates further down the list.  A detailed analysis on this update can be found on my [Windows 7 ESU Analysis](https://hackandpwn.com/windows-7-esu-analysis/) post.

| KB4528069 |Windows 7 SP1 ESU Verification | This optional update will help verify that eligible Windows 7 SP1 devices can continue to get Extended Security Updates (ESUs) after the end of support date of January 14, 2020. | [Windows6.1-KB4528069-x64.msu](https://github.com/HackAndPwn/Windows-7-Patching/raw/master/01_Enable_ESU/01_Windows6.1-KB4528069-x64.msu) <br>&nbsp;<br> [Windows6.1-KB4528069-x86.msu](https://github.com/HackAndPwn/Windows-7-Patching/raw/master/01_Enable_ESU/01_Windows6.1-KB4528069-x86.msu) |

### Installing Optional Features

The next section of updates enables all optional features not available through Windows Update.  The notable exception from this list is the AD LDS feature, which is discussed in more detail in the next section.

> After installing the Work Folders for Windows feature (KB2891638), an update may appear as available in Windows Update (KB3081954).  However, this update is not required and is replaced with Service Pack 2 (KB3125574).  Once KB3125574 is installed, KB3081954 will no longer appear in Windows Update.

### Installing the AD LDS Optional Feature

The next table describes the updates required to enable and patch AD LDS.

There is an issue if the AD LDS feature is installed after Windows 7 SP1.  If this situation occurs, updates included within the Convenience Rollup (SP2) do not apply correctly.  Therefore, these updates need to be installed manually to fully update the feature.  More details can be found [here](http://windows-update-checker.com/FAQ/ConvenienceRollupKB3125574-Issues.htm).

There are a dozen different updates related to AD LDS on Windows 7 SP1.  However, after careful analysis, only half of them have components not replaced by other updates.  These unnecessary updates related to AD LDS are: KB2898997, KB2922852, KB3042816, KB3160352 , KB3184471, and KB3198591.  The required updates are listed in the table below.

> After installing the first AD LDS Update (KB975541), an update may appear as available in Windows Update (KB2853587).  However, this update is not required and is replaced with KB3012660.  Once KB3012660 is installed, KB2853587 will no longer appear in Windows Update. 

> After installing the first AD LDS Update (KB975541), another update may appear as available in Windows Update (KB3184471).  However, this update is not required and is replaced with the latest ESU Windows 7 Cumulative Update.  Once that is installed, KB3184471 will no longer appear in Windows Update.

### Installing the Convenience Rollup (SP2) and running the System Update Readiness Tool

There are two large updates that can be applied next.  The first is the Windows 7 Convenience Rollup, which is also considered SP2 for Windows 7 and includes a collection of hotfixes and updates.  The second update is the System Update Readiness Tool.  This update will not show as installed, so this is included to be executed once (verifying SP2 installation integrity).

> After installing Service Pack 2 (KB3125574), an update may appear as available in Windows Update (KB4539601).  However, this update is not required and is replaced with the latest ESU Windows 7 Cumulative Update.  Once that is installed, KB4539601 will no longer appear in Windows Update.
