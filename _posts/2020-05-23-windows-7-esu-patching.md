With the May 2020 Windows Updates, I went on a mission to determine exactly what the minimum set of updates are required to enable all options within Windows 7 (and all optional hotfixes).  After extensive testing on both VMs and a laptop, I concluded that 35 updates not offered through Windows Update would reach this objective.  The following sections describe the updates required and provide links to each.

Note 1: The base test image used for this testing was 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1.  Microsoft Update was enabled, and all updates offered through Windows Update were installed.  All links and details within this post were only validated on 64-bit, although 32-bit should have a similar set of results.

Note2: I highly recommend both the [KUC Update Checker](https://windows-update-checker.com/) and [WSUS Offline Update](https://www.wsusoffline.net/) utlities.  I used both during this investigation in order to get to the minimum required set.

### Enabling ESU

This first section only contains a single update required for ESU updates.  A detailed analysis on this update can be found on my other blog post [Windows 7 ESU Analysis](https://hackandpwn.com/windows-7-esu-analysis/).
