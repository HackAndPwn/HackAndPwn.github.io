title: Windows 7 ESU Patching

With the May 2020 Windows Updates, I went on a mission to determine exactly what the minimum set of updates are required to enable all options within Windows 7 (and all optional hotfixes).  After extensive testing on both VMs and a laptop, I concluded that 35 updates not offered through Windows Update would reach this objective.  The following sections describe the updates required and provide links to each.

Note 1: The base test image used for this testing was 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1.  Microsoft Update was enabled, and all updates offered through Windows Update were installed.  All links and details within this post were only validated on 64-bit, although 32-bit should have a similar set of results.

Note2: I highly recommend both the [KUC Update Checker](https://windows-update-checker.com/) and [WSUS Offline Update](https://www.wsusoffline.net/) utlities.  I used both during this investigation in order to get to the minimum required set.

### Enabling ESU

This first section only contains a single update required for ESU updates.  A detailed analysis on this update can be found on my other blog post [Windows 7 ESU Analysis](https://hackandpwn.com/windows-7-esu-analysis/).

### Installing AD LDS Optional Feature

The next table describes the updates required to enable and patch AD LDS.

There is an issue if the AD LDS feature is installed after Windows 7 SP1.  Essentially, if this situation occurs, updates included with the Convenince rollup do not apply correctly.  Therefore, these updates need to be installed manually in order to fully update the feature.  More details can be found [here](http://windows-update-checker.com/FAQ/ConvenienceRollupKB3125574-Issues.htm).

There are a dozen different updates related to AD LDS.  However, after careful analysis, only half of the have components not succeeded by later updates.  The required updates are listed in the table below.

The unnecessary updates related to AD LDS are: KB2898997, KB2922852, KB3042816, KB3160352 , KB3184471, and KB3198591.
