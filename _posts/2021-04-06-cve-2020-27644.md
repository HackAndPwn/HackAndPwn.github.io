The Inventory module of the 1E Client 5.0.0.745 doesn't handle an unquoted path when executing %PROGRAMFILES%\1E\Client\Tachyon.Performance.Metrics.exe. This may allow remote
authenticated users and local users to gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious file called cryptbase.dll to the C:\Windows\Temp\.
