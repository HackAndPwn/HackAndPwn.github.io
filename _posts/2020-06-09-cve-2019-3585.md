Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows client (McTray.exe) in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE) 8.8 prior to Patch 14 may allow local users to interact with the On-Access Scan Messages - Threat Alert Window with elevated privileges via running McAfee Tray with elevated privileges.

When the process McTray.exe runs with elevated privileges, VSE might spawn a process inheriting the parent's privileges. This issue exposes the system to be manipulated by an attacker.
